# draft - refactored libre dollop 
update the current depths and combine the interesting developments.. refactored-dollop; the only thing that is now necessary is types around how commands are sub translated. FOr the moment it just will do the initial stuff.. 

# deps
I have bits of 3 projects in mind vector original stuff, a recent project i noticed that did it well, the line stuff somebody did recently.. and the previous arch.. 

# todo
1. are the deps kinda okay to use, without including too much
2. if not should they be static deps ( most likely - the release cycle for the project is very very very slow ) so its gonna be a build include
3. i actually found the best version that wasnt the extreme - rewrite too much version
